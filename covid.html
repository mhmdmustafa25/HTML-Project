        <h1>?How can computer science contribute to stop the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
            <ul>
            The question of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world.
AI tools can help in many different ways. 
                <li>They are being used to predict the spread of the coronavirus</li> <li>map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis</li><li> and in the development of potential treatments</li><li> while also helping policymakers cope with related issues</li><li> such as the impact on transport</li><li> food supplies and travel</li>.
But in all these cases, AI is only effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from. As COVID-19 has taken the world into unchartered territory, the "deep learning" systems, which computers use to acquire new capabilities, don’t necessarily have the data they need to produce useful outputs.
            </ul>

        <p>ICT information technologies proved to be very helpful in improving big data collection processes and analytics in various fields of social sciences, medical, economic, etc. ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies helped to reduce the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic ( Covid-19) on societies, economy, health care institutions, etc. These technologies have made it possible to increase the scale of digitization and Internetisation of remote communication processes as well as social, economic and other processes. Thanks to the implementation of ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies to remote communication processes, economic processes and the improvement of analytical processes implemented in various scientific disciplines, many institutions and economic entities have managed to significantly reduce the negative effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to the aforementioned technologies, the scale of the health, economic, social, etc. crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is much smaller than it would be if these technologies did not exist. Therefore, the current fourth technological revolution has proved to be very helpful in reducing the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on the functioning of people, the operation of public institutions, economic entities and entire economies. If this type of pandemic appeared, for example, in the middle of the 20th century, i.e. before the development of computer science and the third technological revolution, then the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on people and entire economies would be several times higher than that recorded in 2020.
        and The use of pattern recognition techniques can be helpful for localization the existing of the cells of the virus in the body for example Russia uses facial recognition to tackle Covid-19. City officials are using a giant network of tens of thousands of cameras - installed with facial recognition software. An interesting New York Times article last week posited that governments’ use of digital surveillance techniques for the COVID-19 response – such as the tracking of geolocation to gauge quarantine restrictions – would lead to more pervasive digital tracking in the future. On a related note, there have been reports of an increased use of facial recognition technologies as governments use digital tools to respond to the outbreak.</p>
