        <p> Clean your hands before you put your mask on as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time<br>
Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin<br>
When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin<br>
Don’t use masks with valves.</p>
